      STI rates are hitting record numbers, yet testing is lacking. We want to
      fix this by providing a more discreet and convenient way of maintaining
      sexual health for you. The easier it is to access and learn about your
      health, the easier it is for you to take meaningful action, whenever you
      need it.
